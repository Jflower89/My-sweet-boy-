    <h1>💖 I am so grateful to have you in my life. I want to love you and be loved by you for an eternity. 💖</h1>

    <p>I've loved with all my heart, only to have it broken. Now, I'm afraid to offer it again. But with you, I want to trust, to be loved without being hurt or feeling like I'm too much. I want to feel like I belong somewhere. I'm tired of running, tired of feeling lost. 💕</p>

    <p class="heart">❤️</p>

    <p>Here's a cute little animal just for you! 🐾</p>
